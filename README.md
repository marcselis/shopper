# Shopper

### A Services UI Composition and SOA sample

The original goal of this set of samples was to show concepts described in ["The secret of better UI composition"](http://particular.net/blog/secret-of-better-ui-composition) blog post. It evolved to a full SOA sample that aims to be a playground to implement and showcase concepts from the [ADSD Course](http://particular.net/adsd) by [Udi Dahan](http://www.udidahan.com).

Shopper is a trivially simple e-commerce solution, far away from being ready for any production system, that implements the following high level business capabilities:

#### Product catalog

A minimal product catalog, with categories support.

#### Product search

Ability to search products via a google-like search engine, with faceted results support.

#### Shopping cart

#### Stars and Reviews

#### Checkout process

#### Product Catalog back-office
